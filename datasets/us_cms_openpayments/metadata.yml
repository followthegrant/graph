    The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is a federal agency
    within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that
    administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state
    governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program
    (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. In addition to these
    programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative
    simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care
    facilities (more commonly referred to as nursing homes) through its survey
    and certification process, clinical laboratory quality standards under the
    Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and oversight of
    HealthCare.gov. CMS was previously known as the Health Care Financing
    Administration (HCFA) until 2001.
