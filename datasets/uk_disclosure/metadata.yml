  description: |
    The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) is the trade
    association for over 120 companies in the UK producing prescription
    medicines for humans, founded in 1891. It is the British equivalent of
    America's PhRMA; however, the member companies research, develop,
    manufacture and supply 80% of the medicines prescribed through the National
    Health Service.
