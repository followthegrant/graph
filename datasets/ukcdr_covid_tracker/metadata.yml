summary: |
  This is a live database of funded research projects across the world related
  to the current COVID-19 pandemic, as part of the COVID CIRCLE initiative. By
  providing an overview of research projects mapped against the priorities
  identified in the WHO Coordinated Global Research Roadmap: 2019 Novel
  Coronavirus, we support funders and researchers to deliver a more effective
  and coherent global research response. To our knowledge it is one of the most
  comprehensive databases, covering a wide breadth of research disciplines.

    Through mapping and bringing together key players, UKCDR provides a coherent
    picture of the UKâ€™s spend on international development research. Doing so, we
    hope to harness the true power of UK-funded research to address the major
    challenges that confront our evolving world.
